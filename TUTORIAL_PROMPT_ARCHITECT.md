# üöÄ Tutorial: The Prompt Architect Studio

Welcome to the Prompt Architect, the most advanced tool in the CharaForge arsenal. This guide will explain what it is, where to find it, and how to use it to generate exceptionally high-quality narrative prompts.

## üéØ What is the Prompt Architect?

Think of it as an **intelligent prompt composer**. Instead of you giving a simple instruction to the AI, the Prompt Architect acts as a master storyteller. It takes small, creative pieces from **all of your installed DataPacks** and weaves them together into a complex, detailed, and coherent narrative prompt.

**The Goal:** To generate rich, unexpected, and high-quality base prompts that you can then use in the main generator or any other AI image tool. It's a laboratory for creative discovery.

## üó∫Ô∏è Where to Find It

The Prompt Architect Studio is an exclusive tool for administrators.

1.  Navigate to the **Admin Panel**.
2.  In the sidebar navigation on the left, click on the link labeled **"Prompt Architect"** (with the flask icon üß™).

This will take you to the `/admin/mixer` page, which is the home of the Architect.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It

The interface is simple but powerful. Here's a breakdown of the controls:

### 1. Focus Module

This is the most important setting. It tells the Architect what the "main subject" of the prompt should be.

-   **`Character Focus`**: The generated prompt will be centered around describing a character in detail. Great for creating portraits or character reference sheets.
-   **`Scene Focus`**: The prompt will prioritize describing a location, atmosphere, and environment. Ideal for generating landscapes or background art.
-   **`Action Focus`**: The prompt will emphasize movement, verbs, and dynamic events. Perfect for creating exciting action shots.
-   **`Integrated`**: This is the default and most versatile option. It creates a balanced prompt that includes a character, a location, and an action, weaving them all together.

### 2. Seed (Optional)

A "seed" is a number that controls the randomness of the generation.

-   **Leave it blank:** If you leave the seed input empty, the Architect will generate a completely new, random prompt every time you click "Generate".
-   **Enter a number:** If you get a prompt that you really like, you can see the seed that was used to create it. If you enter that same seed number again and click "Generate", **you will get the exact same prompt back**. This is called reproducibility and is great for fine-tuning a result you liked.

### 3. The "Generate" Buttons

-   **`Generate` / `Generate with Seed`**: This button runs the Architect using the currently selected Focus Module and the (optional) seed number you've entered.
-   **`Random Seed`**: This is a shortcut button. It will generate a new random seed for you and immediately run the Architect, giving you a completely new and random prompt with one click.

### 4. The Output

The large text area at the bottom will display the final, generated prompt. You can then copy this text and paste it into the main Character Generator's input field to create a character based on that rich narrative.
