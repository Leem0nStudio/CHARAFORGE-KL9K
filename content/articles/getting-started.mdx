Welcome to CharaForge, your new toolkit for bringing fictional characters to life with the power of generative AI. Whether you're a writer looking for inspiration, a game master building a new world, or an artist visualizing a concept, CharaForge is designed to be your creative partner.

## What is CharaForge?

At its core, CharaForge is a web application that combines user-driven prompts with advanced AI models to produce:

-   **Unique Character Portraits:** Generate high-quality images of your characters in various styles.
-   **Detailed Biographies:** Create rich backstories, personalities, and motivations from a simple concept.
-   **Organized Character Sheets:** Keep all your character's information in one place, from their appearance to their equipment.

## Your First Character

Getting started is easy. Head over to the **Character Generator** to begin. The process is broken down into a few simple steps:

1.  **The Concept:** Start with a simple description. This can be as basic as "a grizzled space detective" or as detailed as you like. You can use Danbooru-style tags for more precise control.
2.  **Generate Details:** Our AI will take your concept and flesh out a full character sheet, including a name, archetype, and biography.
3.  **Generate Portrait:** Review the generated text and use the physical description to create a visual representation of your character.
4.  **Save:** Once you're happy, save the character to your personal gallery.

From there, you can edit, version, and share your creation with the community. We can't wait to see what you create!
